# 🌤️ **Weather App** 🌎

Welcome to my **Weather App**! This app allows users to search for weather information by city name or their current location, providing them with real-time weather data and a beautiful, dynamic interface that updates based on the weather conditions.

---

## 🧑‍💻 **Tech Stack** 💻

- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (to store user data and search history)
- **API**: OpenWeather API (for fetching weather data)

---

## 📝 **Features** 🎉

- **Account Creation**: Users can create an account and save their weather search history.
- **Weather Search**: 
  - Search for weather by **city name** 🌆 or by **current location** 🌍.
  - Displays **daily weather** with **3-hour intervals**.
  - Shows **5-day weather predictions** 🌦️.
- **Dynamic Background**: The background color and image change according to the current weather (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy) 🌅🌧️🌈.
- **Search History**: Users can view and access their past searches.
- **Weather Overview**: Users can see detailed information on the current weather, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.

## 📝 **Problem Statement:**

Build a **Weather Application** where:
- Users can search for weather information by entering a **city name** or using **location-based search**.
- The app should provide **real-time weather data**, including a **5-day forecast**.
- The app should have a **dynamic interface** that changes based on the weather conditions.

## ⚙️ **Challenges Faced** 🛠️

- **Integrating the OpenWeather API** to fetch accurate weather data and display it efficiently.
- Implementing **user authentication** for account creation and storing **search history** securely in **MongoDB**.
- Dynamically changing the **background** and **color themes** based on weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy).
- Ensuring a smooth user experience while handling **weather data updates** every 3 hours and displaying them cleanly.
- **Data Formatting**: I had to format the weather data in the backend before sending it to the frontend for easy representation and display.
- The app was initially optimized for **phone view**, but I'm now working on making it **responsive for laptop/desktop views** as well to improve the user experience across devices.
